H-Bridge Circuit with 2N2222 Transistor 
It is an amazing project in which all the basic work is done by the single IC. The 2N2222 is a simple yet common IC . The project contains the simple and clean circuit that works properly and moves the motor in both direction i.e, clock-wise or anti clock-wise according to need.
